# Python-Trojan
A python trojan, 2 programms, one you need to get on your victims pc and one on your own pc. [This is for educational purposes ONLY]

In the slave.py script enter the ip adress of your own pc. Then (auto)run the script on the victim pc. Whenever you feel like it, you can then start connecting by running your local script. Now you have (almost) full terminal controll, including self-script functions like upload and download.

Possible Improvements:
To make it more secure you could change it so that the victim pc doesnt have your ip adress in their script, but you theirs. Only problem is that if the victim pc changes its ip adress, you wont be able to connect anymore, unless you find out the new ip adress. In the current version you are always able to connect if you just know what ip adress you need to have in order to connect to the other script.
